# HTTPS Configuration Guide for Precision Visual Website

## What Was Implemented

### 1. âœ… Security Headers Added
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents mixed content issues
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **upgrade-insecure-requests**: Automatically converts HTTP to HTTPS

### 2. âœ… .htaccess Configuration (z:\Precision_Visual\PV_Website\.htaccess)
- HTTPS redirect rules
- Security headers at server level
- Performance optimizations (compression and caching)
- Content Security Policy configuration

### 3. âœ… JavaScript Security Script (z:\Precision_Visual\PV_Website\assets\js\https-security.js)
- Client-side HTTPS enforcement
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS conversion for links and images
- Additional security measures

### 4. âœ… HTML Meta Tags Updates
All main HTML pages now include:
- Security meta tags for HTTPS enforcement
- Proper SEO descriptions
- Canonical URLs pointing to HTTPS versions
- Updated titles for better SEO

### 5. âœ… SEO and Search Engine Configuration
- **robots.txt**: Directs search engines to HTTPS version
- **sitemap.xml**: All URLs use HTTPS protocol
- **security.txt**: Security policy disclosure

## GitHub Pages HTTPS Setup

### Enable HTTPS on GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/JeelDadhania/PV_Website
2. Click on **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under "Source", ensure it's set to deploy from main branch
5. **IMPORTANT**: Check the "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox
6. Your custom domain `precisionvisual.in` should have HTTPS enabled

### DNS Configuration Check:
Make sure your domain DNS settings are correct:
- A records should point to GitHub Pages IPs:
  - 185.199.108.153
  - 185.199.109.153
  - 185.199.110.153
  - 185.199.111.153
- Or CNAME record pointing to: jeeldadhania.github.io

## Testing Your HTTPS Setup

### 1. Basic HTTPS Test
- Visit: https://precisionvisual.in
- Check if it loads without certificate errors

### 2. Security Headers Test
Use online tools to test:
- https://securityheaders.com/
- https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

### 3. Mixed Content Check
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for any mixed content warnings
- All resources should load over HTTPS

### 4. Force HTTP Test
- Try visiting: http://precisionvisual.in
- Should automatically redirect to HTTPS version

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Not Secure" Warning
**Cause**: Mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)
**Solution**: All implemented scripts will convert HTTP to HTTPS automatically

### Issue 2: Certificate Errors
**Cause**: GitHub Pages HTTPS not enabled or DNS issues
**Solution**: Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings, wait 24-48 hours for certificate provisioning

### Issue 3: Redirect Loops
**Cause**: Conflicting redirect rules
**Solution**: The .htaccess file has proper conditions to prevent loops

### Issue 4: Cache Issues
**Cause**: Old HTTP versions cached
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and wait for CDN cache to expire

## Files Modified/Created:

### New Files:
- `.htaccess` - Server configuration for HTTPS and security
